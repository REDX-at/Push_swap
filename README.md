Push Swap is a project focused on sorting algorithms and stack manipulation. The objective is to implement a sorting algorithm that efficiently sorts numbers using two stacks and a limited set of operations.

## Introduction
The Push Swap project challenges students to design and implement a sorting algorithm using only push and swap operations on two stacks. This exercise helps develop problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of sorting techniques and stack data structures.

## Key Concepts
1. Stack Operations
Implement basic stack operations such as push, swap, and rotate. Understand how these operations can be used to manipulate data and sort elements effectively.

### 2. Sorting Algorithms
Develop and apply sorting algorithms to arrange numbers in ascending order. Explore different strategies for sorting with stacks, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, or other efficient algorithms.

### 3. Algorithm Optimization
Optimize your sorting algorithm to handle large datasets efficiently. Focus on minimizing the number of operations and improving the performance of the sorting process.

### 4. Complexity Analysis
Analyze the time and space complexity of your sorting algorithm. Understand the trade-offs between different algorithms and operations in terms of performance and efficiency.

### Features
Stack Manipulation: Use push, swap, and rotate operations to sort numbers between two stacks.
Custom Sorting Algorithm: Design and implement an algorithm to sort numbers efficiently.
Optimization: Optimize your solution to handle large inputs and minimize operations.
Performance Analysis: Evaluate and analyze the performance of your sorting algorithm.
